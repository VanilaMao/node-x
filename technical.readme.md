## Architecture
  
  ## Main Technology
     As scalability, maintainability, testable, reliability are required, additionally, stockx is 
   a real-time data virtualization system, so a CQRS +ES server is a potential solution for horizontal scale and maintainability. 
   Since the database is PostgreSQL, for maintainability purpose, an ORM is much easier to maintain and design. Also, 
   in order to minimize possible bugs and teamâ€™s cooperation, typescript is very useful.
   So a CQRS Node Js framework (NestJs) + TypeORM is the most reasonable technology to implement real-time, scalable, maintainable 
   project in Node Js
